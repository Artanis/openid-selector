  * Is Facebook missing from the list?
    * Facebook is not currently operating as an OpenID Provider, it's not possible to use Facebook credentials to log into other websites. They're not advertising well how they're operating as an Relying Party either, it's not obvious how to use other credentials to log into Facebook.
